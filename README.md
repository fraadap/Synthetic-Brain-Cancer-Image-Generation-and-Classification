# Synthetic-Brain-Cancer-Image-Generation-and-Classification
This project leverages artificial intelligence to address ethical and privacy concerns in healthcare by generating synthetic brain cancer images. The goal is to create a synthetic dataset that closely resembles real data, enabling effective training of machine learning models without compromising patient privacy.
